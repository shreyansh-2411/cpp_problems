Encapsulation: it is wrapping up of data into an single entity . While using classes we are implementing encapsulation as classes wrap up various data members and data functions into an single entity i.e. the class . A fully encapsulated class is an class with all the data members as private , Encapsulation is data Hiding 
Inheritance: inheritance is reusing the existing data of an existing class into another class , Inheritance is used to have the blue print of an exiting class inside a new class alogin with the properties of new class . Protected access specifier comes into play with inheritance as while inheriting private members and member functions can not be inherited and proted can be inherited but apart fomr inheritance they act similarly to the private members . Inheritance is of multiple types : Single , Multi level , Multiple , Hierarchical and Hybrid inheritance . In inheritance we can also understand the use of scope resolution operator ( :: ), if we are inheriting two classed into a single class ( multiple inheritance ) an both of the parent classes have a fucntion with same name than how will the child class know that which function is being called if both have same operator , to solve this problem we will have to use scope resolution operator to specify the class that function belongs to .
Polymorphism: When we have multiple utilites of something than that is called polymorphism , eg - if we have a function called task and it can do multiple things as it has multiple definations . We differentiate between these definations by changing the arguments and using this we can make a function perform multiple tasks , this is called function overloading and same can be done with operators as well by wrting some utility for any operator we can make it behave differently with our objects. Polymorphism is of two types - compile time ( normal polymorphism ) and run time polymorphism which can only be acheived through inheritance where two functions with same name exists in different class but are inherited into a single class .
Abstraction: abstraction is hiding of the implementation . While we make a class we can have multiple data members and function in it a person who will be using this class can use all the functionalities via functions defined in this class and in this way he will be getting the functionality while the actual implementation will be hidden in the class.
