Linked lists are squential linear data that are stored in non contigeous memory locations . They work by storing data and pointer to next data location in a single variable ( user defined variable ) that is how the data members of a linked list are linked to each other and as they are not contigeous random elements can not be accessed in a linked list .
Linked lists have some advantages over the arrays : With linked lists size does not needs to be defined and on resizing no heavy operations are performed ( this refers to vectors ). Adding and deleting elements from the middle of an array requires heavy operations which is not the case with linked lists .Linked lists show there advantages over the arrays in the areas where array needs to be resized or if the memeory available for allocation is fragmanted , In this case array will not be able to allocate large sequence as it needs contigeous space and linked list will work perfectly here .
