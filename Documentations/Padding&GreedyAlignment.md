Compilers sometimes allocate more space for a class than required , This is done to have faster memrory access . When memory is being fetched there can be two scenarios . Either memory is aligned in some perticular manner or it is done as per required memory . In the first case if the memory is alligned in some perticular manner it becomes easier to access memory and operations becomes much more faster .
To achieve this compiler will allocate more space to a class than required for exampel if a class have there data memebers ( int , char and char ) , it should idealy take up 6 bytes of memory but if our compiler follows greedy Alignment ( type of alignment for faster access ) than 14 bytes of memory will be allocated as in greedy allignment each data member will take up the storage of biggest data member to have the data stored in such a way that each data member will start with a memory location which is a multiple of the biggest memory location like in our case each data member will start at 4,8,12 and so on .
Padding is this extra space allocated for faster memory access this space will not be used but still it will be allocated for that variable and this extra space will be called padding .
