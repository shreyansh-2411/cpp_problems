In C++, iterators are objects that provide a way to access and traverse the elements of a container in a sequential manner. They act as pointers to elements within the container and allow you to iterate over the elements, access and modify them, and perform various operations on the container.
They operate just like pointers , When you use * uniary operator with them you can get the element they are pointing to and if you will increment an iterator it will move to the next element , This shows that they work similarly to pointers but when we try to print an pointer we get the address of the variable that the pointer is pointing to but if we try to do the smae with iterators we will get an error as iteratiors are not pointers and they do not work to serve a general purpose of pointing to any variable whose address is stored in it . Pointers are a pre defined objects that are used to iterate through structures that they are defined for .
Pointer can be used to point any element whos'e address we have but iteraters can only point to the elements of the stucture they are created for , thus they provide a better and safer method to acces members of any structure like vectors and that is the reason why they were opted.
begin() function will return the iterator to the first element of the vector and end() function will return iterator to the element next to the last element of the vector
Auto keyword is generally used to define a iterator , auto keyword is ot specifically ment to define an iterator , auto keyword is a c++ functionality that allows us to define any variable without defining its data type , This lets compiler pick the correct datatype at the time of initialisation .
Iterator defination : vector<int>::iterator a; and as you can see this is not the easiest thing to remember that is why we use the auto keyword to define an iterator .
