Object Oriented Programing is a way of writing programe that makes our code much more redable , reusable etc. It does not impact our code in logical manner , it is only adopted to make our code organised as while working on a big project it is important to keep track of everyting and for that we follow Oops standards . It is not just for making the code readable but it also makes writing codes easier , eg: If we are making a game like takne we will have to defien multipel characters like Gin , Paul etc and for each characters there will be some charactorstics like therir health , name etc and they will have some behaviours as well like attacks defences . Each charactor will have theri unique features and if we don't follow Oops we will have to remember behaviours fo each charactor which will be hactic and to handle that we use classed to group these behaviours and charactorstics in a single variabel using classed and this helps keep track of things .
Classes are a user defined data type , they are used to create a datatype that server our user case of storing some data of multiple datatype in a single variable , If we want to store some data in classes we will used an Object ( i.e. an instance of a class ) as an variable . Objects can access the data in an instance of the class 
Classes are bluprints of the datatype that we want to creat , In a class we define our variables structure i.e. the members of the class and memeber functions of the class .
When we create an object of a class than we can either create it dynamically or statically , In dynamic memory allocation data will bestored in the heap sectino of the memory and when the scope of class will end we will have to manually deallocate the memory as it is not done automatically like static object allocation .
We can have access Mdifiers in calasses , which specift the access rights of the class , They can be used to to specify how the data members and function can be used and where they can be called throught out their scope
Constructors are special member functions of a class that exists in the class by default but can be modified if we declare them manually , Once a constructor is declared manually the default constructor will automatically be ignored by the compiler and we will have to make sure that it is being called by us as compiler will throw an error if it is not called , Constructors are used if we want to define some variables or do anyting at the time of object creation as they are automatically called when an object is created and if we do not define a object the code will still work the same as compiler will execute the default constructor which will not impact the functionality of the code , We can use it if required .
While using copy constructor ( used to copy data from one object to another ) we need to know about shallow and deep copy , This concept comes to action when we are dealing with pointers , In shallow copy the address in the pointer of one object is coppied to another object and if value is change for 1st object the second object will change as well as they are pointing to the same address to solve this we use deep copy that is we define a copy constructor which will copy the data itself instead of just address.
Destructor is used to deallocate memory and is called once the object goes out of scope , Desctructor will get automatically called in case of statically allocated object but for dynamically allocated object we will have to call it ourself .
Static members of a class are the members which are associated with the class itself unlike the other members which are associated with the object instead of the class . Associated with class means that they will remain same for each object and can be modified but if modified they will be updated for every object and they don't need object to be called they can be called directly without object . Static function can only use static memebers as they don't need object and other memebers need object for there initialisation .
When we use a copy constructor we need to make sure that we pass the arguments as pass by reference instead of pass by value as when we pass the arguments as pass by value a copy of the argument is created and in case of copy constructor the argument is of class type and to copy it a copy constructor will be called which will create a infinite cycle of copy constructor being called .
